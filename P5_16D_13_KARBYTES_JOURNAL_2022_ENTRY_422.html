<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too schoozy to get a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop ogling at yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You only have yourself to talk about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have that much to talk about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not everything revolves around you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think everything revolves around you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh uh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm mm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mmm hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Uh huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ooo. Ooo. Ooo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Psssssssp. Psssssssp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waaaaaaah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop recording yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop behaving yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop meowing at yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ooo. Ooo. All you think I do is eat? Ooo. Ooo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Nobody wants to listen to you anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get over yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bye Karlina!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody loves you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I&#8217;m not as narcissistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long does it take for you to get a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Finished?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I don&#8217;t have anything to look forward to but animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re only allowed to sleep next to your dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about the father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You only talk to your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You only talk to your name brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I&#8217;m not all about Oedipus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one wants to have sex with you anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too rich to get a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Awwwww.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re only allowed to lay down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Da da?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daaaa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All you think about is you, Karlina.&#8221;</p>
<p>The phrases above are a small sampling of the typical things that bratty baby-talking <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_419/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voice over</a> has been barraging me with. (Especially within the past 24 hours &#8220;she&#8221; has sounded ornery, fatalistic, sullen, angry, and determined to ruin what little fun I am having (and &#8220;her&#8221; central message seems to be: <span style="background:#ffff00">It&#8217;s not okay to live for yourself. It&#8217;s only okay to live for others</span>). I also recorded a 40 second video of me mimicking what &#8220;she&#8221; sounds like. I have a feeling that I am far more bothered by that &#8220;entity&#8221; than are most (if not all) other humans. That &#8220;entity&#8221; feels like the opposite of being a geek and nerd. That &#8220;entity&#8221; feels like someone who makes being a chatty little girl mandatory (which reminds me of the screenshot taken from a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia article</a> I read which describes the main characters in &#8220;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&#8221; and how the descriptions of those characters suggests that only Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Rarity, and Fluttershy are &#8220;normal&#8221; while the other characters are too nerdy or else too jock-like and masculine).</p>

<p>(I am also reminded of that &#8220;If you wanna be my lover, you gotta be cool with my friends, friendship lasts forever, friendship never ends&#8221; song by The Spice Girls which used to play in the Gotta Eatta Pita store I used to work for back in 2019 and 2020; little girls on too much sugar after inhaling helium and celebrating female friendship over hanging out with dudes).</p>
<p>I am also reminded of a poster I saw on the wall of the break room at a Target store in Hayward which I was briefly working for in late 2016 and fired from for &#8220;lackluster&#8221; performance as a cashier which said, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay not to be okay&#8221; (in reference to mental health awareness). I thought that sign implicitly suggested that it is okay to feel crappy and to have low self-esteem but it is not okay to feel good and to have high self-esteem (because employees (especially women of color (especially Hispanic/Latina wimmim (especially the fat ones)))) are supposed to be humble, meek, mild, downtrodden, lethargic, unimaginative, soft spoken, monotone, bland (yet sexed up like a prostitute), almost illiterate, barely graduated high school, lacking science/mathematical/technical aptitude and interest, easily amused by small animals and young kids, content to eat nothing but junk food, disturbingly unoriginal, and complacent). Apparently I am &#8220;too white&#8221; and &#8220;too male&#8221; for wanting to be relatively autonomous, cerebral, physically active, solitary, and relatively stoic instead of whimpering with sex appeal and social appeasement.</p>
<p>(Well, I am on my way to a place to interview for a cashier position at a pizza restaurant. I look forward to getting that over with).</p>
