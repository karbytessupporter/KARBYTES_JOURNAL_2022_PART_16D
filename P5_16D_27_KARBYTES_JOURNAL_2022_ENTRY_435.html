<p>I was fortunate enough to find the black metal fold-up chair which I placed in a bush so that other people would not be likely to see it and then remove it. I am sitting on that chair now rather than sitting on the ground in my usual cross-legged or reclining position. Without a chair to sit in, my back muscles feel strained and my leg circulation frequently gets cut off (and it is generally just ergonomically inefficient (which causes me to waste energy merely trying to be comfortable)).</p>
