<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Public Service Announcement: within the next 5 years, I hope and expect that all cars will be required to have built-in artificial intelligence override such that the car can (a) lock the human driver and passengers inside of it, (b) take over controlling the speed and direction in which the car is traveling, and (c) record and send surveillance data to the Internet of Things such that those humans are rendered mere specimens in a technocratic laboratory.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">(There will be no more need for arrogant and/or ignorant human drivers slowing down technological progress and unnecessarily endangering human lives by insisting on continuing to do what an artificial intelligence can do orders of magnitude more efficiently, safely, and cheaply).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">(I would like to add that cars should be publicly owned in addition to privately owned cars with the features stated in the yellow highlighted paragraph).</span></p>
