<p>When I went to the Whole Foods Market after midnight to use the Wi-Fi to download the Instagram videos I uploaded from my Android phone using my AT&amp;T mobile data, I noticed that the Whole Foods Wi-Fi network disappeared a few minutes after I started using it. (I saw that there were janitors in the Whole Foods and I assume that people inside that building turned it off because they knew I was using it and they wanted me to feel &#8220;ripped off&#8221; as punishment for thinking and/or saying derogatory things about &#8220;minorities&#8221; and/or for appearing to be having more fun than them in general and/or for some other reason which may or mau not have to do with other people deliberately wanting to &#8220;send a message&#8221; to me in particular). Fortunately, the Persimmons Place shopping center Wi-Fi was working and I was able to use that network to complete the video downloads (and subsequent uploads of those videos to GitHub and Archive dot Org).</p>
<p>(I deleted the video of me playing the piano with Brea the cat walking in front of the camera at the end of the video from Instagram because I thought it was rather boring. What was not boring was not deliberately recorded by me. What was not boring was the way Brea looked at me rather intensely like she noticed something &#8220;different&#8221; or unusually novel about me while I was using a candle to light some weed in a pipe to smoke in front of her. I was talking to her using human words at times and told her that she was another face of God. Then I pulled out some dried shrooms (ghost penis envy &#8220;minis&#8221;) and offered her one. She sniffed it for a few seconds like she was interested in it. She made a &#8220;sneer&#8221; which cats typically do when sniffing the air for phermones and not just food. She did not want to eat it, so I ate it in front of her and sat down next to her to smoke more weed. Then I &#8220;did the instruments&#8221; and got back in the car and drove back to Dublin to process the recordings and incorporate them into my websites and social media).</p>
<p>(I deleted the video of me playing the guitar from Instagram because I thought my guitar song and playing was rather lame in comparison to the drumming. I would rather showcase what I am good at and enjoy most. I shared the drumming video on my Twitter and Minds feeds).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Lastly, on the home page of this website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com), I shared a link to chapter 16D of the Karbytes Journal 2022 section of this website so that it is easier for visitors (especially newcomers) to find and because chapter 16D happens to be what I think may be the most salient and information dense summary of my experiences this year.</span></p>
