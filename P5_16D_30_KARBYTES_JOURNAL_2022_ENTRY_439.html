<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following two notes were made on my phone (by using Gmail to email myself those notes) earlier this evening. They are relevant to my <strong>goal</strong> to spread my favorite <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memes</a> across the Internet inside of at least one <strong>space-time continuum</strong> which is unconditionally retrievable by beings who attain a sufficiently high degree of consciousness (which may be afforded by the passage of death and psychedelic drug usage and by <strong>using</strong> simulated augmented reality hardware and software.</span></p>

<p>Not driving a car while most other humans do and while billions do each day does not make a significant difference towards saving the environment. To keep myself rationally optimistic about the future, I tell myself that eventually all the scientific research and technological development humans have been working on will yield scalable solutions to virtually all of humanity&#8217;s problems such that all human individuals will be able to enjoy what I think is a minimally decent standard of living. I consider my role within human civilization to be a single person Internet empire and public domain media outlet which helps to consolidate the best informational resources I can procure and make them as universally accessible and what I consider to be as aesthetically pleasing, logically sound, and useful for solving humanity&#8217;s problems as possible. In January 2023 I tentatively plan to apply for warehouse jobs (especially in the cannabis industry) so that I have a means to earn money to fund my Internet based empire&#8217;s maintenance and expansion and curation while minimizing how much I interface with the general public face-to-face because, as a high functioning autistic, socialization tends to be unsatisfying for me unless I am socializing with people I consider to be sufficiently like minded. To some people, my refusal to work as a customer service &#8220;agent&#8221; in a retail setting is &#8220;cheating&#8221; in a game where most people are conned into spending what I think is too much of their precious cognitive resources on shallow and sycophantic interpersonal exchanges. So be it! I am admittedly a selfish hedonist (just like all the other humans are). I would rather be direct and blunt and unambiguous and honest when expressing my personal beliefs, preferences, and intentions. Thank you for your time and attention.</p>
