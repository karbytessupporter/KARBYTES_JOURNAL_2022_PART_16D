<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I have decided to set the following goals for myself:</p>
<p>1. Save at least $10 per day most days of the week (and each day I expect to receive at least $40 from my mom). That is so that I have some &#8220;emergency funds&#8221; to fall back on and am not totally broke. (Note that I have a backup Windows 10 laptop at home and a Ubuntu bootable USB flash drive which I intend to use in case I am unable to use my current laptop).</p>
<p>2. Stop attempting to contact AJP and stop responding to AJP&#8217;s attempts to contact me. That is so that I can move on with my life whether or not AJP and others are ready for me to. (Note that I think that AJP may have government granted access to my electronics and the right to psychotronically harass me from a good safe distance (but so far I still seem to have normal control over my thoughts and behaviors aside from the fact that I am constantly spammed with &#8220;mind control&#8221; propaganda which does cause me significant inconvenience at least as much as it appears to help me achieve my goals)).</p>
<p>3. Stop writing journal entries which do not pertain to status updates in the context of achieving my personal goals. That means that I expect my future blog posts and social media activity to be relatively egocentric, apolitical, emotionally neutral, sparsely worded, and limited to natural science (i.e. physics, chemistry, biology), technology (e.g. Internet and World Wide Web, artificial intelligence, robots), engineering (e.g. computer programming, building and testing electronics), mathematics (e.g. calculus, probability, Boolean algebra, discrete mathematics), epistemology (e.g. inquiry about the nature of existence, metaphysics, secular study of world religions, culture, and anthropology (of humans and other sufficiently advanced species)).</p>
<p>4. Deepen my practice of mindfulness meditation, self inquiry, psychedelic usage, and being as self reliant and hermetic as possible. By abstaining from what I think are mostly wasteful distractions which other people might treat as compulsory mainstream conventions, I expect to garner more value out of my time and thoughts than I think what people who conform to the extroversion-centric, breeder-centric, hyper-consumerist, and anti-intellectual and anti-individualistic mainstream norms are able to. I expect to be ostracized and even punished for my failure to conform to such a mainstream but I strongly believe that my goals (as counter-cultural as they may currently be) are more than worth the sacrifice and punitive consequences.</p>
<p>5. Avoid sharing updates about my personal life unless those updates pertain to the progress I have already made towards achieving my goals. That means that I intend to avoid announcing my goals before they are fulfilled for now on (even if that means that I appear to other people to have no ambitions nor opinions nor newsworthy anecdotes to share). The Internet and general collective consciousness of human civilization is already very saturated with what I think is redundant, distracting, and otherwise low-quality content. I need not contribute more junk to that cloud of (mostly) junk. (What I see is that most of the humans around me are too cranky to express themselves in an eloquent, inspiring, interesting, and helpful manner because most people end up having almost no free time apart from merely doing survival oriented and social approval oriented tasks which takes up most of their time, energy, and money). I believe that many people (if not most people) see me as not doing enough to &#8220;earn my keep&#8221; and, as a result, those people think that I deserve to be ostracized, ridiculed, sabotaged while pursuing my personal goals, and treated as unworthy of admiration and of being taken seriously.</p>
<p>Lastly (though this is not exactly a goal), I hereby give myself and anyone else permission to kill itself for any reason at all. I do not think it is sufficiently worthwhile for me to continue suffering to exist if I think that I am physically being prevented from achieving my most important goals. Such a show of endurance in those circumstances does almost nothing to contribute value to my life because none of my most important goals pertain to &#8220;showing off&#8221; how good I am at tolerating misery for as long as possible (regardless of whether or not other humans admire me for such a show of endurance).</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
