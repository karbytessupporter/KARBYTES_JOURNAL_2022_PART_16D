<p>While perusing the website of a local public library, I read that a person is only allowed to use the library computers for an hour per day. If a person wants to seriously &#8220;break into tech&#8221;, that person will need its own computer and Internet access. What I am trying to do is figure out how cheaply a person can &#8220;break into tech&#8221;. The laptop computers I have been using tend to cost less than $500 and I usually purchase them online using a gift card which my mom gives me and then going to the store to pick up the product I ordered. The phones I have been using tend to cost less than $100 and I usually purchase them from Target stores. What I do to establish an Internet connection is use my phone to establish an Internet hot-spot using a USB-C cable to connect my laptop to the Internet from various locations (and I pay $30 per month for basic AT&amp;T phone coverage and $20 per every 3 gigabytes of mobile Internet data). I usually install a Ubuntu operating system onto my laptop or else use a Ubuntu operating system from a bootable flash-drive instead of installing the Ubuntu operating system onto that laptop (because a backup laptop I have which is pre-installed with the Windows 10 operating system will seemingly not allow me to install Linux onto the hard drive). My smartphones tend to have the Android operating system (which seems to be the most common phone operating system for &#8220;poor people&#8221; while &#8220;rich people&#8221; tend to use iPhones and Apple products). A simple part-time or full-time job doing cashiering at some retail outlet should be sufficient to maintain this &#8220;break into tech&#8221; setup (and such jobs seem to pay an employee at least $15 per hour for at least 20 hours per week (which is at least $300 per week)).</p>

<p>My job seems to be helping &#8220;poor people&#8221; become &#8220;rich people&#8221; by showing them how by example. Unfortunately, what ended up happening is that, by working for &#8220;poor people&#8221;, I ended up feeling trapped in the ghetto and deprived of my former affluence (which I am on a mission to get back to and to have more of than ever before). I have been told by &#8220;poor people&#8221; (especially Hispanics) that I do not need to be so ambitious and affluent and that I should, instead, stop being so cerebral and, instead, settle for being poor and complacent so that I can be happily part of the &#8220;poor people&#8221; for the rest of my life. Rather than continue trying to help the &#8220;poor people&#8221; break into tech, I have decided to leave them behind to fend for themselves and treating them like a &#8220;lost cause&#8221; at worst. I do think that eventually they will be saved by a universal basic income and technological progress which makes society more affluent in general. <span style="background: #ffff00">As selfish as this may sound, I would rather identify as an undergraduate computer science student with less than two years left of college before I expect to have enough technology skills to showcase in a portfolio and perhaps collaborative project experience as a result of attending hackathons and to qualify for full-time technology jobs (especially software development) than identify as some martyr who is here to be more of a social worker than a software developer/technician. What I like about Information Technology (especially software development) is that it is very &#8220;do it yourself&#8221; and easy to do from a variety of locations and for relatively little money. What really seems to keep &#8220;minorities&#8221; from successfully &#8220;breaking into tech&#8221; is a lack of time (because those &#8220;minorities&#8221; tend to be drained of time and energy just trying to survive and maintain what tepid comforts they have).</span></p>
