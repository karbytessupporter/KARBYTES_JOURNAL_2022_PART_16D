<p><span style="background: #ffff00">One aspect of hackathons which I remember is that the maximum number of persons per group was five while the minimum number of persons per group was one.</span></p>
<p><span style="background: #00ffff">My preference is either to register for a hackathon as a group consisting of exactly one person or else to join a group consisting of either three, four, or else five persons.</span></p>
<p><span style="background: #00ff00">(I do think that more than five people would start to feel a bit bureaucratic. Meanwhile, I think that exactly two people would feel too much like a therapist counseling a client or else a married couple bickering over how to do a collaborative project).</span></p>
