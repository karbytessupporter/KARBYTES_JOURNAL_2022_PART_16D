<p>From 01_JUNE_2012 to 30_SEPTEMBER_2015, I worked as a student intern in the Information Technology Collaborative Services department at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory getting paid $13.65 per hour to write and debug Google Apps Script (a proprietary brand of JavaScript for building client-side and not server-side web applications which enable interaction between Google products such as Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Google Spreadsheets) web applications for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory employees to use to manage their employee Google accounts (e.g. using a tool I developed to batch forward email messages which have a specific label to some recipient email address) and to do other tasks such as write and edit technical documents in the lab&#8217;s Information Technology Help Desk Wiki Commons web pages and to test video conference and video recording hardware and software (e.g. testing the battery capacity and video recording capacity of a video recorder by letting it record a video for as long as possible without charging it nor pausing the recording process and then documenting the results). Each Friday I was able to input the total number of hours I worked (whether I worked remotely or in the office) and was trusted to be honest and to not cheat about the number of hours I worked.</p>
<p>To this day I believe that my internship at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was one of the most valuable things I ever did with my time because it enabled me to get &#8220;real world&#8221; experience working in the Information Technology sector when I might has otherwise not gotten the chance to without graduating college first. Admittedly, I felt that the work I did at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory during that internship was not very essential to the functioning of the laboratory, but it was useful in helping me learn to accept my obsolescence and the widespread obsolescence which will happen when most jobs are outsourced to robots and only the most talented humans will be given &#8220;essential&#8221; projects to work on while everyone else at that company is given &#8220;toy&#8221; projects to work on so that every human working at that company can enjoy being able to apply what they learn in school and to enjoy being part of a collaborative work culture (rather than be told to just stay home and be an invalid living on a fixed income where their skills and health are likely to deteriorate due to a lack of structured routine and productivity-fostering environment which emphasizes focusing on challenges which are larger than merely attempting to maintain homeostasis (i.e. survival and comfort)). What I am trying to say is that having professional settings in which to work (even if the work is &#8220;just for fun&#8221; and/or to prepare for more competitive and serious work) prevents humans from feeling bored, lonely, and lacking in a sense of accomplishment (and I say this hoping and assuming that all people will be living on an unconditional basic income within the next ten years so that having a job is no longer a prerequisite to being able to afford a place to rent, food to eat, and other basic necessities and tools which enable people to be productive and healthy).</p>
