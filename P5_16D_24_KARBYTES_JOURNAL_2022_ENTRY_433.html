<p>I left my tent with both of my blankets in it where I last set it up on the plateau approximately 100 meters north of the East County Hall of Justice in Dublin, California.</p>
<p>Then I bought some groceries at the Whole Foods Market, got in &#8220;my&#8221; car (which was parked at the East Dublin BART parking garage), drove it to the nearest gasoline station to put in $10 worth of gasoline into the car tank, drove to the local Department of Motor Vehicles to renew my driver&#8217;s license for $40 (which included taking a new photograph and asking the staff to change my mailing address to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SED&#8217;s</a> (which means that SED&#8217;s address instead of my dad&#8217;s address will be displayed on the new driver&#8217;s license)).</p>
<p>Then I drove the car back to the East Dublin BART parking garage and walked back to my camping spot to discover that my tent has been removed (along with the stuff in it).</p>
<p>Now I only have one cheap flimsy blanket (which is in the car) and a tarp for privacy and rain protection. Rather than try to replace my tent (which I do not have the funds for), I am just going to try my best to make do with what I have. To find the &#8220;silver lining&#8221; in my situation (i.e. and that metaphor is a common idiom in my culture of origin for finding &#8220;the good&#8221; in a situation which is typically thought of as &#8220;bad&#8221; (which is akin to seeing the beauty in rain clouds which would otherwise be dreary)), I will say that I have less stuff to worry about and more incentive to hang out in parking garages instead of in a tent. (Unlike tents, parking garages afford more shelter from the rain, better lighting at night, more space to move around in, and more direct access to utilities such as electrical outlets, drinking water fountains, and bathrooms).</p>
<p>Just because I do not have a tent does not mean I still cannot camp at &#8220;the turkey tree&#8221; when it is not raining. I can hear people yelling as I type this in protest of me trying to maintain a higher standard of living than they seem to want me to have. Well, I am at war with those people if that is the case. That&#8217;s not because I enjoy being at war with other people. It&#8217;s because I want to minimize how much other people prevent me from having a good time. Hence, I hang out in relatively secluded locations when I get the chance to (and I especially appreciate locations which are abundant with wildlife and other expressions of naturalistic beauty (i.e. formations which were not engineered by human intent but, instead, formations which arose as a result of phenomena which humans do not seem to intentionally bring into effect (though it does seem that I live in a world where humans seem to want to take credit for everything that exists as though they are literally the one and only god of my reality)).</p>
<p>Anyway, one advantage of having little more than what I carry on my person to call my total possessions makes it relatively easy for me to travel and adapt to unexpected changes in my plans. I have less to lose than someone who has devoted many hours and years of its life to buying a house.</p>
<p>(I am sitting inside of my &#8220;cheap tent&#8221; which consists solely of a tarp as I write this note. At night, I will most likely sleep in the corporate area under the overhangs. No one has called the cops on me yet in that area. Instead, the people there usually tell me to kindly leave when they are open for business (and one of the business owners in that area said I could camp in front of their building but I would have to leave before it opens for business. I know that many people want to &#8220;force&#8221; me to revert back to sleeping at my parents&#8217; houses and spending most of my free time there, but I am against that because doing that would afford me too little privacy for my comfort)).</p>
