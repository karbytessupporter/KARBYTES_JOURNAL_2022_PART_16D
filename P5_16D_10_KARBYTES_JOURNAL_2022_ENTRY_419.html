<p>I think it is very likely that I might not be able to update the first 26 pages of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com by the end of the year 2022; especially if I get a job during the remainder of 2022.</p>
<p>At best what I have to look forward to is almost 100% drudgery related to making progress towards accomplishing my goals. At worst what I have to look forward to is being slowed down or else entirely prevented from making progress towards accomplishing my goals due to extreme hardships such as serious disability, incarceration, and loss of essential personal items which I lack the means to replace.</p>
<p>I decided to take my tent down so that it would not be a hassle to deal with if people see me camping and come over to bug me, arrest me, fine me, and/or destroy or soil my tent or whatever is in it if I leave it unattended. I might set it up again later, but I think it might be good to go even more &#8220;low profile&#8221; and hide under the overhangs in some corporate areas in Dublin that I used to have success hanging out at in the past. The rain is off and on again and has been that way for the past week. Because I have not showered in over a week, I decided that today would be a good day to drive (and not walk and take BART because of the rain) to my dad&#8217;s house to shower, do laundry, and play my guitar and/or the drums.</p>
<p>That little girl voice has been annoying as usual. I imagine what she looks like is a cross between Porky Pig, Betty Boop, Tweety Bird, and Veruca Salt. She sort of looks like a Muppet with big doey eyes while talking in a smug, soft, cooing, baby talking falsetto. She looks like a more prepubescent and pudgy version of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_40/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samantha</a> with a pink flushed face which is short and round with childlike bone structure, lots of eyeliner, and a facial expression and intonations which makes it look like she is always whimpering and crying (like she is in pain and needs to go potty but wants someone to carry her to the bathroom but will not admit it because she is unwilling or else unable to do anything but make annoying, childish, attention-seeking sounds and gestures which communicate little more than, &#8220;Look at me! Stop what you are doing and be my audience! Don&#8217;t take your attention off me for even a millisecond! I want baby! Gimme milky! Daddy come fuck me! I wanna wittle boooaybeee to take caiw of that looks like me. Oooooo! Ooooo! Da Da!&#8221;). She makes &#8220;ooo&#8221; sounds a lot and annoyed whining sounds like she is having an orgasm while taking a shit and she wants me to pay intense attention to her every move literally at all times. She sounds like she is lying on her back in her underwear with her short fat legs in the air kicking in protest while she screams and moos angrily and plaintively and acts like she is trying to fart out a baby and get me to be her midwife while she does. She has a slightly New York accent and pronounces &#8220;dog&#8221; as &#8220;dooawwwg&#8221; (and she often says, &#8220;Geddajoooaawb!&#8221; because she wants me to have more money to spend on her and only her). She sounds like she is emulating a little girl (preschool aged) who is trying to be erotic; very demanding of attention; very whiny; and making her mouth shaped like an O a lot. Her mouth is always moving. She acts like she is fake shell shocked because she gasps erratically and makes fake surprised and fake scared facial expressions because she gets off on being a victim who can do no wrong in the eyes of whatever her encompassing society is (where girls and wimmin are treated like fragile, stupid, weak, crying babies who are supposed to act petulant, wimpy, and attention deficit while boys are men are treated like combat-ready body guards, authorities, and possessive keepers of girls and wimmin). She hyperventilates and, between noisy inhalations, she breathily and hastily whispers passive aggressive taunts. Her mouth and throat sound very tiny. If I could get away with murdering her without consequences, I would throw her off a very tall cliff or even have her murdered in a more violent and painful way such as getting mauled by lions. I doubt I would get away with murdering the princess. Sadly, there is no way for me to get away from her while she follows me everywhere I go and interjects in every one of my thoughts with her ugly noises. I will nevertheless try to have as much fun as I can and make as much progress towards my personal goals as I can even while that brat keeps draining me of my energy, time, and patience. (Just as I wrote that last sentence, I heard someone honk their car horn seemingly in irritation because they want me to be as miserable as the princess wants me to be (and a big SUV can driving down the parking garage ramp past me (and the vast majority of cars around me are large gasoline guzzling SUVs which look like military tanks))).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">I apologize if the 2022 journal entries in this website have been tedious and unpleasant to read. I am looking forward to having much more enjoyable and personally meaningful subject matter to write about in 2023.</span> I will let the 2022 journals be a &#8220;time capsule&#8221; containing stuff I am sick and tired of having to keep being reminded of which seems to be threatening to take up way too much of my time, attention, and creative output. I want Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the Karbytes Journal 2023 section of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com to be a relatively pristine and inspiring refuge to go to in order to escape being trapped in a social and governmental environment which is depression-mongering, anti-intellectual, chauvinistic, violence-mongering, punishment-obsessed, retribution-driven, jealousy-driven, fear-driven, apathetic to existence beyond human civilization, politically conservative, and stifling of free thought and free expression of ideas.</p>

<p>WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE &#8220;REAL SHIT&#8221;, YO!</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s not &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221;; it&#8217;s &#8220;yo&#8221; (because &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221; implies all persons while &#8220;yo&#8221; implies at least one person but not necessarily all persons).</p>
